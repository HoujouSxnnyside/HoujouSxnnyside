## 🧠 How I Build

I think in systems.

Structure first.
Interaction second.
Implementation with intent.
Polish until it feels inevitable.

I don’t chase trends.
I compose solutions.

Some projects scale wide.  
Some go deep into one specific need.

Both are valid — when intentional.

## 🛠 Technical Stack

Curated. Not decorative.

</p>

The stack adapts to the architecture.  
Not the other way around.

Each tool here earned its place.

Different problems require different architectures.
This stack reflects that.

<details>
<summary>📎 Previous Eras</summary>

Java and Kotlin were part of the native-first phase.  
LaTeX belonged to the academic systems stage.
Static HTML pages without frameworks.
Material Design Apps without proper design system.

Evolution is part of system design.
